# fall-2019-music-suggestions

Platform for artists and performers to showcase their talents and find clients based on their local availability and collaborate (artists, photographers etc.). This platform will be a hybrid between linkedin and etsy, but specifically for artists and performers, where they can have their portfolios, references, endorsements, and scheduling all in one place.

This project came to be because our team is comprised of multiple artists and we noticed a lack of this service in the industry. We have often been in situations where we have wanted to show off our portfolios but did not know how other than through social media.
